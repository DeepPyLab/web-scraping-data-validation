**# Web Scraping and Data Validation**

**## Description**

This project is a Python application designed to scrape weather data from a website and validate the correctness and consistency of the scraped data. It demonstrates skills in web scraping, data handling, and validation. The project uses popular Python libraries such as `requests`, `BeautifulSoup`, and `pandas` for scraping and data manipulation, and `pytest` for testing.

**## Features**

- **Web Scraping:** Extracts weather data (date, temperature, condition) from a specified website.
- **Data Validation:** Ensures that the scraped data is correct and consistent.
- **Testing:** Includes unit tests to verify the functionality of the scraper and validator.
